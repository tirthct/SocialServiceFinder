            There are many people who would like to do community services, but don't know the places that
						offer the
						opportunity for the same. We aim to provide a platform not only to people who seek non-profit
						organizations for any opportunities where they can contribute, but also to encourage more people
						by
						rewarding them for doing good deeds. We plan on helping the organizations that are looking for
						volunteers to help them.
