### Abstract

There are many people who would like to do community services, but don’t know the places that offer the opportunity for
the same. Our project aims to provide a platform not only to people who seek non-profit organizations for any
opportunities where they can contribute, but also to encourage more people by rewarding them for doing good deeds. We
also plan on helping the organizations that are looking for volunteers to help them.

We are planning to create a web platform that creates and manages volunteering opportunities (posted by social service
organizations). Users can search for an opportunity based on various criterias like location, type of service required,
type of organizations listing the opportunities, etc. For motivating the users, rewards from various partner companies
will be offered to those who volunteer in these events. We are planning to implement a microservice based architecture
using SOLID principles, and create a complete system with a reactive frontend, scalable backend software and a NOSQL
database. For internal communication within the services, we will be using Messaging channels between them. We are
focusing on microservice based architecture because we want to create a robust, maintainable and a highly scalable
system in a way that makes it easy to add more features in the future, supporting Agile methodology. We are also
planning to cover the features using functional tests.
